git-repo-merge
==============
Written by: Ian Llewellyn

git-repo-merge is a small bash script that does the laborious and error prone
work that a human is not really fit to do. It's a simple bash script that will
make your life easier if you need to merge some distributed components into one
complete project.

Usage:
git-repo-merge <source-repo> [source-repo]* <destination-repo>
